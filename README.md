# Dependency-Injection-Python

This repository contains basic example on how to use Dependency Injection in Python. 

How to run - 
1. Modify config with your email address and password in main.py
2. Change the Subject for email search in main.py file
3. run command "python main.py" 

The program should return list of tuples containing subject, to and from information of latest matching email. 
For example, [('SUBJECT', '{EMAIL_SUBJECT}'), ('TO', '{TO_EMAIL_ADDRESS}'), ('FROM', '{FROM_EMAIL_ADDRESS}')]
